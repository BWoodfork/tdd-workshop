### Fizz Buzz instructions

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
For numbers that are not multiples of either 3 nor 5, simply return the number.

For example:

When your program is given `1` is prints `1`
When your program is given `3` is prints `Fizz`
When your program is given `5` is prints `Buzz`
When your program is given `15` is prints `Fizz Buzz`

### String calculator instructions

Write a program that takes a string mathematical expression of two numbers and prints the result of the calculation. Your program should have the ability to add, multiply or subtract two numbers. If your program is given a number without a mathemtical expression, your program should simply return the number. 

For example:

When your program is given `1` is prints `1`
When your program is given `1+1` is prints `2`
When your program is given `300+1000` is prints `1300`
When your program is given `100-500` is prints `500`
When your program is given `5x10` is prints `50`

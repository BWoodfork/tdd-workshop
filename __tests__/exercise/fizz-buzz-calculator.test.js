// Write a program that returns the numbers from 1 to 100. 
// But for multiples of three returns “Fizz” instead of the number
// and for the multiples of five returns “Buzz”.
// For numbers which are multiples of both three and five returns “FizzBuzz”.
// For numbers that are not multiples of either 3 nor 5, simply returns the number.
